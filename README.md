# MegaMan

A clone of the bomber level from Mega Man, made for a programming course.

This was the first C++ that I made.

The project was made with an SDL framework made by my teachers.

While making this project, the main things that I learned were:
* How to make a camera from scratch
* How to animate sprites using code
* How to collision checks on SVG's
